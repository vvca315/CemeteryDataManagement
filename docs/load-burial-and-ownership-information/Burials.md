Existing aerial imagery, parcel, and CAD data may be useful when
creating new cemetery data. Add these layers to the Cemetery Data
Management map before creating cemetery data.

Hardcopy cemetery maps can also be georeferenced and used to automate
cemetery data. If your organization has scanned historical cemetery
maps, you can add them to the map and use ArcGIS Pro\'s georeferencing
tools to begin automating your cemetery data.

To georeference cemetery maps, complete the following steps:

1\. On the Map tab, in the Layer section, click Add Data.

2\. Browse to the raster dataset you want to georeference. Select it and
click OK.

3\. Select the raster dataset in the Contents pane.

4\. On the Imagery tab, click Georeference.

5\. Use the tools on the Georeference tab to create control points, to
connect your raster data to known positions in the map.

6\. Review the control points and the errors.

7\. Save the georeferencing result, when you are satisfied with the
alignment.

The georeferenced raster data can then be used in subsequent tasks to
automate cemetery data.
