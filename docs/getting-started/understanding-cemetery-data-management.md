Cemetery Data Management can be used to organize foundational cemetery
data in ArcGIS. This data can be loaded from existing source data or
digitized from existing cemetery maps.

Cemeteries are typically subdivided into a series of areas (for example,
sections, blocks, lots, and gravesites). Burial and/or ownership
information is commonly associated with a given gravesite.

The solution uses five layers to represent the subdivisions of a
cemetery:

\- Cemeteries

\- Sections

\- Blocks

\- Lots

\- Gravesites

Related burial and ownership information is stored in two tables:

\- Burials

\- Owners

The following task groups are organized to help you load existing source
data or digitize cemetery data using hardcopy maps.

\- Create cemetery data will guide you through creating new data using
existing hardcopy maps or related source information.

\- Load cemetery data will guide you through loading existing GIS data
into the layers provided.

\- Load burial and ownership information will guide you through loading
existing burial and ownership record information into the tables
provided.
